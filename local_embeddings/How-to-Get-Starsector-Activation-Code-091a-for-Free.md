The activation code is provided by SsethTzeentach, a popular YouTube reviewer who made a video about Starsector in 2019. He shared his code with his viewers as a way of supporting the game and its developer. The code is **starsectoractivationcode185** and can be entered in the launcher after downloading the game from [here](https://fractalsoftworks.com/category/releases/).
 
Using this code will give you access to the full game, including all the new features and content added in version 0.9.1a. Some of these are:
 
- Rebalanced colony progression so itâs both not as demanding of constant attention and doesnât immediately catapult the player into the endgame
- Improvements to ship AI, in particular escort behavior and carrier survivability
- Two new capital ships, used by the pirate and Pather factions, and a new pirate skin for the Shrike
- A ârandomized startâ option
- Various quality-of-life improvements
- Reworked high-end fleet spawning â generates more large ships, and fewer ships overall, instead of just a larger number of ships
- Large fleets can now disengage without being pursued if they can deal enough damage in a pitched battle first, even if they lose it
- Added ambient sound track when visiting a portside bar
- Assorted combat balance tweaks
- Many bugfixes and modding-related improvements

If you enjoy the game, you should consider buying it from the official website to support the developer and get future updates. Starsector is still in active development and has a lot of potential to become one of the best space games ever made.
  
Starsector is not just a game about flying and fighting in space. It also has a deep and complex economy system that allows you to trade, smuggle, pirate, raid, and colonize planets. You can choose to align yourself with one of the existing factions, or create your own and compete for resources and influence. You can also customize your ships and fleets with various weapons, hull mods, skills, and doctrines.
 
The game also has a rich lore and backstory that is revealed through exploration, missions, and interactions with characters and factions. The setting is a post-apocalyptic galaxy where a mysterious event called the Collapse has caused the collapse of civilization and the loss of most advanced technology. The remnants of humanity are scattered across the Sector, struggling to survive and rebuild. You can discover ancient secrets, hidden dangers, and powerful relics as you explore the Sector.
 
Starsector is a game that offers a lot of freedom and replayability. You can play it in different ways and have different experiences each time. You can also mod the game and add new content, features, and mechanics. There are many mods available for Starsector that enhance the game or add new factions, ships, weapons, missions, and more.
